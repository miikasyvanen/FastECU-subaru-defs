This repository is used to develop Subaru ECU definitions for use with:

- FastECU https://www.fastecu.fi/forum
- ECUFlash http://www.tactrix.com
- Romraider http://www.romraider.com

# WARNING

These definition files are created as the result of the extremely complex and time consuming process of reverse-engineering the factory ECU. Because of this complexity, it is necessary to make certain assumptions and, therefore, it is impossible to always deal in absolutes in regards to representations made by these definitions. In addition, due to this complexity and the numerous variations among different ECUs, it is also impossible to guarantee that the definitions will not contain errors or other bugs. What this all means is that there is the potential for bugs, errors and misrepresentations which can result in damage to your motor, your ECU as well the possibility of causing your vehicle to behave unexpectedly on the road, increasing the risk of death or injury. Modifications to your vehicle's ECU may also be in violation of local, state and federal laws. By using these definition files, either directly or indirectly, you agree to assume 100% of all risk and FastECU's creators and contributors shall not be held responsible for any damages or injuries you receive. This product is for advanced users only. There are no safeguards in place when tuning with FastECU. As such, the potential for serious damage and injury still exists, even if the user does not experience any bugs or errors. As always, use at your own risk.
